# WaveFire

My attempt at a vscode color theme. It is currently optimized for Flutter which means that it will look off in other languages.

Since the color theme still needs a lot of polishing, I am not posting it on the vscode marketplace for the time being.

## Installation

Copy this folder into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart vscode.
